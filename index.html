            The stainless steel test vehicle, called SN5, has been compared variously to a 
            grain silo and water tank. But it could pave the way for a spacecraft capable of 
            carrying humans to the Moon and Mars. Shortly after the test flight, which lasted 
            just under a minute, SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: "Mars is looking real."
